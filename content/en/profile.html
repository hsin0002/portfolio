        <h2>Motivation</h2>
      </header>
      <p>I am passionate about bringing intelligence into embedded systems â€” turning algorithms into real, interactive devices. Through my studies at NCU and UTBM, I've built a strong foundation in both hardware and software, exploring how AI and embedded technologies can work together to create smarter, more connected systems.</p>

      <p>My experience in UAV control system development and as a Teaching Assistant in Embedded Systems Design has strengthened my ability to design, debug, and integrate intelligent hardware solutions.</p>

      <p>I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects that connect data, intelligence, and physical systems to make technology more efficient and human-centered.</p>
